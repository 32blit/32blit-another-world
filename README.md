# 32Blit Another World

![Build](https://github.com/32blit/32blit-another-world/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is a port of Another World for 32Blit.

You will need:

1. An SD card
2. The game files for Another World DOS

## Game Files

Files should be lowercase, you'll need:

```
memlist.bin
bank01  bank03  bank05  bank07  bank09  bank0b  bank0d
bank02  bank04  bank06  bank08  bank0a  bank0c
```

Place these either on the root of your SD card on 32Blit, or alongside the Another World binary if you're running locally.
